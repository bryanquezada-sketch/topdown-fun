        /* We define player speed at 160(standard for Phaser probably because it feels just
        right). The reason for this is that it helps later on so we don't have to repeat
        ourselves twice when we set up the movement logic. I can also see it being useful
        if we ever want to have an instance where the player speed is changed like sprinting,
        jumping or moving through rough terrain. We set the player's velocity to 0 in the next
        line because we need a way to stop the player after the movement logic starts. The
        reason this works is because it's in the update() method and thus loops around as 
        one of the first things that gets checked for.*/

        wasd objects(which we defined earlier) are being pressed down, it changes the player's
        (who we also defined earlier) velocity based on which key is being pressed by the 
        variable playerSpeed(set at 160), either adding or subtracting to it.*/

        wins out if both are pressed at the same time without having a sort of flicker
