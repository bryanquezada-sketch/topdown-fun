🎯 So How Should You Think?

Use this mental checklist:

What responsibility is this?
What breaks if it’s removed?
Who conceptually owns this behavior?
Will this grow in complexity?
Does placing it here increase coupling?

If it:

Has a clear domain
Will grow in features
Doesn’t belong to movement
Doesn’t belong to input
Should be reusable

It gets its own controller.


Game architecture scales by separating:

Movement
Intention
Interaction
Rendering
State
Abilities

You don’t mix domains.

You isolate them.
